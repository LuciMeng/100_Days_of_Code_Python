# Day 002 - Bill Split Calculator ðŸ’°

## What I Learned
- **Data Types & Conversion**: Practiced working with different data types and converting user input into numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Calculated tips and split the bill among multiple people.
- **Formatted Strings**: Applied f-strings to make the output clean and readable.

## Project Overview
This calculator split a bill by taking into account the total amount, tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the cost.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and the number of people.
2. It calculates the tip, adds it to the bill, and divides the total by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay.

## Code Highlights
- Collected numeric input using `input()` and converted it using `float()` and `int()`
- Performed calculations to determine the final amount per person
- Used f-strings to display the result with two decimal places
