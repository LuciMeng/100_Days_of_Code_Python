## Blackjack Project

### Overview
This is a simple console-based Blackjack game where you play against the computer.  
It follows the basic rules of Blackjack and lets you play as many rounds as you want.  
I built it to practice Python basics â€” functions, loops, conditionals, recursion, and logic building.

### How It Works
- You and the dealer each get two cards.
- If anyone has Blackjack (Ace + 10), they instantly win and the game ends. 
- You can choose to draw more cards or pass.
- Dealer keeps drawing until their score is 17 or higher.
- Closest to 21 without going over wins.
- Option to restart after every round.

### Highlights
- Clear, separate functions with docstrings.
- Recursion for smooth game restarts.
- Basic Blackjack rules like dealer auto-draw at <17.
- User input for decision-making.
