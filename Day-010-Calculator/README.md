# Day 10 - Calculator Project

## Project Overview
Built a console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator supports continuous calculations or restarting with fresh inputs. 

## How It Works
- Displays an ASCII art logo (from the `art` module).
- Prompts the user for a number, shows available operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), then performs the selected operation.
- Allows the user to continue with the current result, start over, or exit.

## Code Highlights
- Used nested **functions** to handle operations and organize logic.
- Mapped operators to functions using a **dictionary** for clean execution.
- Included a **while loop** to support ongoing calculations.
- Applied **recursion** to reset the calculator.

## Key Takeaways
This project deepened my understanding of functions with return values, loops, dictionaries, and clean input handling in Python.
