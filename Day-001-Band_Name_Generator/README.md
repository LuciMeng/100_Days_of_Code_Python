# Day 001 - Band Name Generator ðŸŽ¸

## What I Learned
- **Printing & User Input**: Practiced using `print()` to display messages and `input()` to get information from the user.
- **Working with Strings**: Learned how to join strings together to form a full message.
- **Using Variables**: Stored user responses in variables and reused them to build the final output.

## Project Overview
This simple program creates a fun band name by combining the user's hometown and the name of their pet.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user for the city they grew up in and their pet's name.
2. It then combines the two responses to generate a band name in the format: `"CityName PetName"`.

## Code Highlights
- Used `input()` to gather data from the user
- Applied string concatenation to build a custom message
