# Day 004 - Rock Paper Scissors Game ✊📄✂️

## What I Learned
- **Lists**: Used lists to store game options and accessed elements by index.
- **Random Module**: Used the `random` module to simulate the computer's move.
- **Game Logic**: Built out conditional statements to determine win, lose, or draw outcomes.

## Project Overview
This game lets the player face off against the computer in a classic match of rock, paper, scissors. The computer's move is randomly selected, and the outcome is decided based on standard game rules.

## How It Works
1. The user selects either rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly picks one of the three options.
3. The game compares both choices and declares a winner.

## Code Highlights
- Used `random.choice()` to generate the computer’s selection
- Structured win/loss logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
