## Day 13 – Debugging

### What I Learned
- **Understand the Problem** – Understand what the code is *supposed* to do and compare that with what it’s actually doing.
- **Reproduce the Error** – Test specific cases to consistently trigger the bug.
- **Play Computer** – Walk through the code line-by-line and simulate what the program is doing.
- **Use try/except** – Catch and handle exceptions so the program doesn’t crash and identify where things go wrong.
- **Use Debugger Tools** – Add breakpoints and step through the program to inspect variable values (`step over`, `step into`).
- **Print Statements** – Quickly display variable values at different points in the program.
- **Stack Overflow** – Search for similar issues and learn from other developers’ solutions.
- **Run Frequently** – Test small parts of the code as I build it.
