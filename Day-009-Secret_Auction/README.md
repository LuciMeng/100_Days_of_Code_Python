# Day 9 - Blind Auction Project

## ðŸ§¾ Overview
This console-based auction game lets users place anonymous bids. 
It reinforced core Python skills like dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
- Prompts each user for their name and bid, storing them in a dictionary.
- Asks if there are more bidders; clears the screen if yes.
- Once bidding ends, the program announces the highest bidder.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
- Used a dictionary to store and manage bids.
- Looped through inputs until no more bidders.
- Defined a function to find the highest bid.
- Practiced real-world interaction with user-driven logic.
