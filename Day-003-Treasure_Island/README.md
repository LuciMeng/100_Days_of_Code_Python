# Day 003 - Treasure Island Adventure üèùÔ∏è

## What I Learned
- **Conditional Logic**: Used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to create branching logic.
- **Game State & Flow Control**: Controlled game flow based on user input.

## Project Overview
This project is a text-based interactive adventure game where the player explores an island and inputs key decisions in the search for treasure. The journey is shaped by the player's input, leading to various endings.

## How It Works
1. The game begins with a scenario and prompts the player for decisions at key points.
2. Each choice leads to a different outcome - win or lose based on conditional logic.

## Code Highlights
- Used multiple layers of `if` statements to build a branching storyline
- Collected and evaluated input using `input()` to control story progression
